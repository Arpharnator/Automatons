  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromColdWarReceiverSignedMajorMavros">You. Declaring war. On us? Aw, bud, I knew you were ugly but I didn't think you were stupid too. Don't worry, we'll smack some sense into you.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromAllianceSenderSignedMajorMavros">Hey, bud, listen. Being pals with you is REALLY frustrating. We've got a big gun the lads have been working on, and I'm just ITCHING to use it. Mind if I aim at your big dumb face? </LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceRelationFromColdWarReceiverSignedMajorMavros">Yeah bud, totally. It'll be nice not having to worry about each other, and maybe we could get some weapon trade going. Just saying.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceRelationFromColdWarReceiverRefusedMajorMavros">Look, it's not like we don't like the idea, but we're busy doing our things and you're busy not doing our things, yeah?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceRelationFromColdWarSenderRefusedMajorMavros">Look, it sounds all fluffy mammals and rainbows, but it wouldn't be honest. Let's keep things on ice.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceRelationReceiverRefusedMajorMavros">Look, it just wouldn't be honest. Let's keep things on ice.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromColdWarSenderProposedMajorMavros">We've been keeping a close eye on you and, gotta say, we like what we see. We could totally form an alliance. What do you say? You and us against the universe, lets get things moving.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromColdWarReceiverSignedMajorMavros">Boom! That's what we like to see. This galaxy's a rough place. We gotta stick together. Glad to be moving alongside you.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromPeaceSenderProposedMajorMavros">Hey, you know, we really appreciate you not trying to screw us over. How's about we make an alliance and get things moving?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromPeaceReceiverSignedMajorMavros">Nice. Looks like we're really in this for the long haul. Whatever we can do to help, let us know. Our scrap heap's your scrap heap so long as its true to other way around, eh?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromPeaceReceiverRefusedMajorMavros">Look, bud, we like having you as neighbors and all, but we're not about to let you go borrowing our stuff, yeah? Good fences make good neighbors and all that.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromPeaceSenderRefusedMajorMavros">Look, bud, we like having you as neighbors and all, but we're not about to let you go borrowing our stuff, yeah? Good fences make good neighbors and all that.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealSenderProposedMajorMavros">Heyy, we're looking to make some trade and this deal here looks pretty sweet! What do you say?</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealReceiverRefusedMajorMavros">Dude, no. Stop rummaging through our stuff.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealSenderRefusedMajorMavros">Dude, no. Stop rummaging through our stuff.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealReceiverIgnoredMajorMavros">Eh, we aren't feeling it. That's a pass for now.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationSignedMajorMavros">You've been real annoying lately, you know? A bunch of my buds wanna get blasting, but let's avoid that, yeah? I'll make you an offer, please don't refuse it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationAcknowledgedMajorMavros">What, you got something against us? Pff, whatever.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionComplimentSignedMajorMavros">Hey, you're alright, bud. Just thought you should know.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionComplimentAcknowledgedMajorMavros">Well shoot, you made me blush, thanks bud. You're pretty alright too.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionInsultSignedMajorMavros">Hey! Screw you too!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionInsultAcknowledgedMajorMavros">Aww that's adorable. Did you eat the crayons you used to write that?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDemandSenderProposedMajorMavros">Hey bud, you're in the way. Here's how you get out of it. Got it?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDemandReceiverSignedMajorMavros">Aww, a demand? That's cute. Get off our screen.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarDemandSenderSignedMajorMavros">Hey, yeah.. About that demand. We all thought it over and came to the conclusion that we really like the idea of shoving it right up your entitled puckers.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarDemandReceiverSignedMajorMavros">It didn't have to be like this, bud. Don't say I didn't warn you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementSenderProposedMajorMavros">So, how about it? This do anything for you?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementReceiverSignedMajorMavros">Yeah, that'll do it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementReceiverRefusedMajorMavros">Come on, bud! You need to sweeten the pot more than that!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementSenderRefusedMajorMavros">Come on. Really? You think we were going to go for this? Even we have standards.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementSenderProposedMajorMavros">Hey, study buddies! What do you say?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementReceiverSignedMajorMavros">Nice! Maybe your guys could help me get my camera working...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementReceiverRefusedMajorMavros">Look, group projects aren't really our style. We don't want to wind up doing all the work and you taking the credit.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementSenderRefusedMajorMavros">Look, group projects aren't really our style. We don't want to wind up doing all the work and you taking the credit.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromColdWarReceiverSignedMavrosPrepareWar">Funny, we were just about to do the same.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceWarToWarAcknowledgedMajorMavros">Guess that treat contract doesn't mean much, eh? Screw you!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCloseBordersReceiverSignedMajorMavros">Get off our lawn and get out of our way!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOpenBordersReceiverSignedMajorMavros">Open borders? Yeah, sure, now we can finally see what you're up to over there.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOpenBordersReceiverRefusedMajorMavros">GO. AWAY.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOpenBordersSenderRefusedMajorMavros">GO. AWAY.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCloseBordersSenderSignedMajorMavros">Yeah, nope! Get out of our space. Don't think we don't see what you're doing over there!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOpenBordersSenderProposedMajorMavros">Hey, uh. This whole closed borders thing is real annoying. We got places to go, things to do. Knock knock?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionIgnoredMajorMavros">....huh, what? Who left the screen on? Oh, I thought we already rejected this. Ugh, will you shut up man!?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionIntroduceYourselfReceiverSignedMajorMavros">Whoa! Who the heck are you? Where'd you come from?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionIntroduceYourselfSenderSignedMajorMavros">Hey, we're the Mavros. Got any trash laying around we could use? No? Ah, well, pleasure to meet you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMapSharingReceiverSignedMajorMavros">Hey, uh, we're a bit lost on where we should be headed, mind if we take a peek at your starcharts?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionVisionSharingReceiverSignedMajorMavros">Hey, now I see you and you see me. Try not to be boring, eh?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelVisionSharingReceiverSignedMajorMavros">What, after all this time NOW you're worried about privacy?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelTradeAgreementReceiverSignedMajorMavros">Dude! You can't go! Where else are we gonna get such high quality scrap from? Maaan... things were just starting to get good..</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelScienceAgreementReceiverSignedMajorMavros">Aw, yeah, see? Called it. Well just be sure to write our name on that project when you turn it in, yeah?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceRelationReceiverSignedMajorMavros">A truce? About time! Where do we sign?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceRelationSenderProposedMajorMavros">Look, we've both got more important stuff to be doing, how about a truce?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceRelationReceiverRefusedMajorMavros">A truce? Yeah, lemme think that over for a while. We'll get back to you!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceRelationSenderRefusedMajorMavros">A truce? Yeah, lemme think that over for a while. We'll get back to you!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMapSharingReceiverRefusedMajorMavros">Look, we share our charts and all of a sudden you're gonna be clogging up our star lanes and stealing all our curiosities. Pass.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMapSharingSenderRefusedMajorMavros">Look, we share our charts and all of a sudden you're gonna be clogging up our star lanes and stealing all our curiousities. Pass.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionVisionSharingReceiverRefusedMajorMavros">Look, not gonna lie, we're really not interested in watching you, and you wanting to watch us is kinda creepy. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionVisionSharingSenderRefusedMajorMavros">Look, not gonna lie, we're really not interested in watching you, and you wanting to watch us is kinda creepy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralPotentialTradingPartnerMajorMavros">We've got a bunch of stuff we don't need just laying around. How's about we swap your trash for our treasure?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralPotentialFriendMajorMavros">Hey, how's it going buddy? You guys doing alright? We should get the gang together more!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementGoodFirstImpressionMajorMavros">Respect, thanks bud.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementSameAlignementMajorMavros">Hey, looks like we hang out with the same folks as you do. We should get the gang together sometime.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementGreatDeedsMajorMavros">Hey, we got your back on this. Keep up the good work.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAskTributeMajorMavros">You look like you've got some dust burning a hole in your pocket. Funny, because we've got these ships that do the same thing to walls...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationYouHurtMeMajorMavros">Wow, that hurts. Why does it have to be like that bud?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationYouWereCruelToMeMajorMavros">Nobody deserves what you did. We'll remember this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationGetOutAfterTrespassMajorMavros">You're getting a little too close for comfort. Scram before I get in a worse mood.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumAfterTrespassingMajorMavros">We're past warnings. Get out or we'll get you out, got it?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumAfterColonizationMajorMavros">Not too sure how we feel about having you so close to us... Try to give us some space or things might get messy, yeah?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationOutpostCompetitionMajorMavros">Dude! We called dibs on that system! Give it back!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNoColonizationProblemMajorMavros">What's up neighbor, glad to see you! Need some help settling in?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationTrespassMilitaryMajorMavros">You know, it's funny, we see all this soon to be scrap flying around our systems and it just won't leave. We might need to get on that.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationRevengeMajorMavros">Oh ho ho, it's on! You don't know when it's coming, but watch out.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarOpportunistMajorMavros">You know, you're flying around in some pretty sketchy toasters, bud. If we were to go to war, you'd be toast.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementProposePeaceMajorMavros">Hey, uh. Look, how's about we make a peace deal? We're cool, right?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDeceiverMajorMavros">You double crossing liar! I hope your kind can sleep with one eye open, you'll need it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationBlockingExpansionMajorMavros">Yo, what the heck man? Leave some systems for the rest of us, yeah? You're boxing us in!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationSneakyDemandMajorMavros">Well that's rude. Who needs enemies with friends like this, eh?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralOpenBordersAcceptedMajorMavros">Alright, cool. Don't mind us, we'll just be passing through.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementTributeReceivedMajorMavros">Well, thanks bud. You really know how to put out a fire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarForExpansionMajorMavros">So, look. Thing is, you took all the good systems in the area. Things are getting cramped here and we need room to breathe. So we figure if you just stop breathing, maybe there'll be some air for the rest of us, yeah?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralManagedToCloseBordersForProtectionMajorMavros">With all these large ships of yours, we can't help but feel like you're compensating for something rather small. You're being obnoxious and it's ticking us off.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNoAttacksSufferedMajorMavros">You're pretty chill, huh? No fighting, no drama. We're down with that.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralDemandAcceptedMajorMavros">Good move, glad we could come to an understanding</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPositiveContractMajorMavros">That's a pretty sweet deal. Thanks, much appreciated.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNoHostileActionsMajorMavros">Hmm, maybe we had the wrong idea about you guys. You're not so bad!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementUltimatumFulfilledMajorMavros">Thanks buddy. Glad you came to see things our way.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumAttackedUnitsMajorMavros">Do you feel big just attacking our people like that? Don't worry, we'll cut you down to size if you want. Watch your back!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumDisregardedMajorMavros">Don't say I didn't warn you, "buddy". When your folk start asking why their kin are getting scrapped, we'll be sure they know it was because of your big dumb ego.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarForSlightMajorMavros">Yeah, look. I know you don't think it's that bad, but it is. War is coming bud, just thought you should know.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationTrespassingMajorMavros">Yeah, no. You're WAY too close. Back off, bud. Folk arent liking how much dirt you're grabbing.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationColonizationMajorMavros">You and yours are in our way, bud. You might wanna BACK OFF before we start complaining to the neighborhood association, got it?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralManagedToCloseBordersMajorMavros">We got some stuff going on right now and would like things quiet, ok? Stay on your side of the fence for a bit.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarForSlightNoClosedBordersMajorMavros">A lot of guns on those ships you have there. It'd be a shame to see them go limp if we pulled ours out, wouldn't it?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAttackedUnitsMajorMavros">Oh yeah, pick on the little guy. We'll be sure to remember that when the tables turn.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNoBribeParagonMajorMavros">Sorry bud, I have to report you to our unions. Bribes aren't taken kindly.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarLongPeaceBetrayedMajorMavros">After all this time you're just gonna do us like that eh? Screw you. Hope you can take the heat we'll be sending your way.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralThinkingAboutScienceAgreementMajorMavros">We could use some help figuring some stuff out and, by the looks of things, so could you. Putting our heads together may be a good idea, you know?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralThinkingAboutTradeAgreementMajorMavros">You got some nice scrap laying around, bud. You ever think about setting up a trade agreement between us?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralMercantileThinkingAboutTradeAgreementMajorMavros">Hold onto your stuff for a sec, bud. You got something we need and we think we got something you want too. A deal's in the works, just give us a bit.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementFruitfulPeaceAcknowledgementMajorMavros">Gotta say, it's nice having you around, friend. Galaxy's a better place with you in it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementFruitfulTradeAgreementAcknowledgementMajorMavros">Dude, this trade agreement has just been awesome. Folks really digging what you're selling.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementFruitfulScienceAgreementAcknowledgementMajorMavros">We still don't know how this screen's supposed to work, but you've been real helpful with helping us figure some other stuff out. Thanks.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerMadeDemandMajorMavros">Some friend you are. Mind explaining what's got you in such a bad mood? Because it's pretty obvious why we're mad...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerRecentlyTrespassedMilitarilyMajorMavros">Just passing through, eh? Might wanna pass faster, bud. Trigger finger's getting mighty itchy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlayerRespectedSovereignSpaceMajorMavros">Thank's for keeping off our turf. The lawn's looking pretty nice now.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationIsolationistPlayerDisregardedTrespassUltimatumMajorMavros">Why's it so hard for you to hear what we're telling you? Friends don't just ignore each other like that, bud.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerRecentlyTrespassedMilitarilyUltimatumMajorMavros">You lost? Get those ships away, fast. Tick-tock.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerMadeDemandAndNoGestureMajorMavros">Mind explaining what we get out of that?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerDisregardedTrespassUltimatumMajorMavros">Why's it so hard for you to hear what we're telling you? Friends don't just ignore each other like that, bud</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlayerRespectedNoTrespassMajorMavros">Thanks for hurrying those ships along, bud. We were getting kinda paranoid there.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerMadeNoGestureMajorMavros">Not gonna lie, kind of hurts that you haven't thought of giving us a gift to show you're serious about things working out here.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlayerMadeGestureMajorMavros">Hey, thanks. This really helps.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionVisionSharingSenderSignedMajorMavros">Things have been kinda boring lately. Mind if we all share feeds for a bit?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelVisionSharingSenderSignedMajorMavros">You know that whole sharing vision thing was nice and all, but now it's over. Sorry.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMapSharingSenderProposedMajorMavros">Ever curious just how much of the galaxy we've seen? Sign here, and we'll show you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementCWNeedHelpMajorMavros">Hey, our ships keep exploding faster than they explode other ships. Mind helping us out with that?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementCWNeedCounterOtherAllianceMajorMavros">Hey, I know we're not close, but we're gonna have to stick together if we're gonna stand up to some of those other goons. How about we make our own team and watch each other's back?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNeedHelpMajorMavros">We've had some good times, right? Look, we could use some help. If we can form an alliance, there's a good chance we can all pull through. What do you say, bud?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNeedCounterOtherAllianceMajorMavros">That alliance over there is really living it up, isn't it? How about we form our own alliance, a better one, with black-jack and scrappers!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAllianceAgainstCommonEnemyMajorMavros">Woah, you're not fond of those guys either, are you? What do you say we get together and put them in their place?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAllianceForGoodRelationsMajorMavros">Look bud. You're awesome, we're awesome, we've been awesome to each other, but you know what'd be more awesome? Coming together and making an alliance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAllianceForVictoryMajorMavros">Great minds, eh? There's room for two on this ride, yeah? What we could do is form an alliance. That way we don't gotta blow each other up and can keep others from blowin us up, yeah?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNeedMilitaryHelpMajorMavros">Erm, we thought we had this war covered, but things have headed south. We're dying here, we need help ASAP!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralHelpingAllyMajorMavros">Looks like you could use some help buddy! Just hold them off until the big guns arrive!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralSendGiftMajorMavros">Here's a little something to show we care. We got this, bud.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralSendGoodGiftMajorMavros">That's right, you're getting something from the top of the scrap heap, but you're worth it, bud.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAlliedDemandNoGiftReceivedMajorMavros">Are you joking? Because it's not funny, no one's laughing. We thought we were in this together.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAlliedDemandMajorMavros">A demand? All you need to do is ask, friend! We're allies, after all. Don't you trust us?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementVeryPositiveGiftMajorMavros">Appreciate the gift, but... can't even remember what we were so mad about before. Here's to our friendship!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralWeakGiftMajorMavros">Look, not that we don't appreciate the offer, but that's really just not gonna cut it. You really hurt us and this gift isn't big enough.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNoHelpThenNoGiftReceivedMajorMavros">This isn't working. You really gotta take a look in the mirror. We wanna make this work but you aren't making that easy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementReceivedHelpLateMajorMavros">Traffic? Well, still, you came. Thanks for the help, even if it's a bit late.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNoHelpReceivedMajorMavros">Hey, friend! If we go down, they're coming after you next. Where's our backup? Get over here!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationConvertedMySystemNoGiftMajorMavros">Wh- what the heck? What'd you say to that system? Why'd they just up and leave like that!?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationConvertedMySystemMultipleMajorMavros">Whoa whoa whoa, are you brainwashing our buddies?! That's it, nope, we're out. We want NONE of that.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAwokeGuardianMajorMavros">Whoa, this Guardian you woke-up is so cool! I mean he's totally in the way (and very flammable), but everyone has a place, right?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementRootedMySystemMajorMavros">Whoa, these glowy vines make ships go faster? How fast? This is awesome, thanks dude!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarAmAlreadyAtWarMajorMavros">Get in line, "buddy". We're busy dealing with an actual war right now. We'll give you a good throttling once we're finished over here?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarNoRoomToExpandMajorMavros">Look, don't take it personal. We need more space and you have the space we need.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarPlayerAlreadyAtWarMajorMavros">Oh look, you've fallen down. Mind if we start kicking?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralBlockadedSystemAtWarMajorMavros">Get your ships off our turf. That blockade is stopping honest folk from living.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralAttackedCiviliansAtWarMajorMavros">You scum! That was a civilian ship you idiot! What'd they ever do to you!?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralAwokeGuardianAtWarMajorMavros">Did we give you the right to awaken freaky monsters on our planets? No! Get your grandpa or whatever out of our way!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralDestroyedMyPlanetAtWarMajorMavros">You blew up an entire planet? Are you TRYING to be a cliche super villain?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlacedPositiveBubbleAtPeaceMajorMavros">Huh, I don't what you did but production has never been higher. Thanks!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlacedNegativeBubbleAtPeaceMajorMavros">What the rift, dude? We liked that system the when it was!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationConvertedMySystemUltimatumMajorMavros">Please stop brain washing our citizens. It's existentially horrifying and creepy as heck. You don't have to force us to you to get us to like you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDisregardedConversionUltimatumMajorMavros">Is it weird to want to kill someone because they're too awesome? Yeah, it is. But you know what's not weird? Wanting to kill someone for putting your friends and family 6 feet under.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementRespectedConversionUltimatumMajorMavros">Thanks for toning down the whole "one of us, one of us" act. It's nice knowing we can think for ourselves.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlacedPositiveBubbleMajorMavros">Cool bubble trick. Don't know why we're suddenly doing party tricks, but we can hang out sometime if you want! Thanks! </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlacedNegativeBubbleMajorMavros">Cool bubble trick. We Marvos can do some tricks too! You wanna see?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationBlockadedMySystemMajorMavros">Alright tough guy, we get it, you got a big old ship with nasty guns. That's sooo cool. Now knock off the blockade before we scrap you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDestroyedMyPlanetMajorMavros">Pretty sure that's a war-crime "friend"! You're sure making it easy to recruit fellas who wanna avenge their families.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementOutpostCompetitionWonMajorMavros">Alright, lets get some friendly competition going on here. Lets see who can set up the coolest mine first!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationOutpostCompetitionLostMajorMavros">DANGIT! How'd you complete that mine so fast? Gah, frickin- enjoy the system, good time.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNoTributeReceivedMajorMavros">I don't know about you, bud. But I think it's getting a little hot in here. Might wanna crack a window. Who knows?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationScaredOfBorderUnitsMajorMavros">Heh, um. Hey bud? We ever mention how grateful we are that you'd never use your cool fighter ships on us? Right?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationScaredAfterAttacksMajorMavros">WHOA, STOP STOP. Geez, we're not looking for a fight! What do you want? You can probably just have it, all you need to do is ask!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationClosedBordersScaredMajorMavros">Hey bud? Your freaky death armadas really got us on edge. Could you move them just a bit further from our border? </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarPreparingHarassWarMajorMavros">Alright bud, square up. Let's see what you got!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarPreparingConquestWarMajorMavros">You're in the way. Pretty sure we told you not to do that.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDestroyedAPlanetMajorMavros">What the heck is that!? You can blow up planets?! How?! Why?!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAfraidDestroyedAPlanetMajorMavros">Wow, destroying planets now, eh? ...we ever mention how good friends we are?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPeaceDestroyedAPlanetMajorMavros">DUDE, what the heck? Mind telling us BEFORE you go and make us galactic super villains?!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAbusedDiplomaticDemandsMajorMavros">We had a deal! Lets see if your ships are as worthless as your word.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementForcedPeaceFromColdWarCordialIdleMajorMavros">Huh, well, um. Yeah, we could be friends. That's cool I guess. You could've just asked though.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementForcedPeaceFromColdWarAfraidMajorMavros">Oh heeey... buddy! Yeahhh, glad to, er, see you! How you been?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementForcedPeaceFromColdWarHostileWaryMajorMavros">Wait, what? You're serious? I mean... that's cool but don't you hate us?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPeaceUnwillingToUnsureMajorMavros">Huh, crazy. You're actually pretty cool. Who would've guessed?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationLeavingForcedPeaceMajorMavros">Dude, if you're gonna bother forcing peace, you need to do something to make us wanna stay in it once your grip loosens. Peace out.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementRequiredShowOfGoodFaithMajorMavros">We're thinking you should show how serious you are about being at peace with us. Got any good ideas?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementGoodFaithReceivedMajorMavros">That gift you sent? We appreciate it. We're doing swell things with it, let me tell you. Peace is good, huh?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNoshowOfGoodFaithReceivedMajorMavros">So, no gift? Well, this peace isn't doing much for us otherwise. You're kinda boring.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationLeavingForcedPeaceWarIntentionMajorMavros">Yeah, so, that forced alliance thing was weird, right? Let's see how war works out.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNegotiationRefusedMajorMavros">Oh my gosh, dude. SHUT. UP. Leave us alone! Bother someone else!</LocalizationPair>
